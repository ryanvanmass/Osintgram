## Docker Quick Start üê≥

This section will explain how you can quickly use this image with `Docker`.

### Prerequisites

Before you can use either `Docker`, please ensure you do have the following prerequisites met.

1. **Docker** installed - [link](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
2. **Credentials** configured - This can be done manually or by running the `make setup` command from the root of this repo

**Important**: Your container will fail if you do not do step #3 and configure your credentials
**Note**: By default the container is set up to only run the AutoDownload.py script

### Docker

If docker is installed you can build an image and run this as a container.

Build:

```
docker build -t osintgram .
```

Run:

```
docker run --rm -v "$PWD/output:/home/osintgram/output" osintgram <target>
```

- The `<target>` is the Instagram account you wish to use as your target for recon.
- The required `-i` flag enables an interactive terminal to use commands within the container. [docs](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/#assign-name-and-allocate-pseudo-tty---name--it)
- The required `-v` flag mounts a volume between your local filesystem and the container to save to the `./output/` folder. [docs](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/#mount-volume--v---read-only)
- The optional `--rm` flag removes the container filesystem on completion to prevent cruft build-up. [docs](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#clean-up---rm)
- The optional `-t` flag allocates a pseudo-TTY which allows colored output. [docs](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#foreground)
